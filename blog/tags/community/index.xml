        &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to create an organization that delivers tens of projects used by millions, nearly no one is paid for doing their job, and still, it has been fruitfully carrying on for more than 20 years? Apache Software Foundation proves it is possible. For the last two decades, ASF has been crafting a model called the Apache Way—a way of organizing and leading tech open source projects. Due to this approach, which is strongly based on the “community over code” motto, we can enjoy such awesome projects like Apache Spark, Flink, Beam, or Airflow (and many more).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this year’s ApacheCon, Polidea’s engineers talked with Committers of Apache projects, such as—Aizhamal Nurmamat kyzy, Felix Uellendall, and Fokko Driesprong—about insights to what makes the ASF such an amazing organization.&lt;/p&gt;
