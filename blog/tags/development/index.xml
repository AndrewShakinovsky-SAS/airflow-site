&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-story-behind-the-airflow-breeze-tool&#34;&gt;The story behind the Airflow Breeze tool&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we started contributing to this fantastic open-source project [Apache Airflow] with a team of three which then grew to five. When we kicked it off a year ago, I realized pretty soon where the biggest bottlenecks and areas for improvement in terms of productivity were. Even with the help of our client, who provided us with a “homegrown” development environment it took us literally days to set it up and learn some basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is how the journey to increased productivity in Apache Airflow began. The result? The Airflow Breeze open-source tool. Jarek Potiuk, an Airflow Committer, will tell you all about it.&lt;/p&gt;
